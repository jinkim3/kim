\arguments{
\item{data}{a data object (a data frame or a data.table)}

\item{iv_name}{name of the binary independent variable}

\item{dv_name}{name of the dependent variable}

\item{mod_name}{name of the continuous moderator variable}

\item{interaction_p_include}{logical. Should the plot include a
p-value for the interaction term?}

\item{iv_level_order}{order of levels in the independent
variable for legend. By default, it will be set as levels of the
independent variable ordered using R's base function \code{sort}.}

\item{output}{type of output (default = "reg_lines_plot").}

\item{jitter_x_percent}{horizontally jitter dots by a percentage of the
range of x values}

\item{jitter_y_percent}{vertically jitter dots by a percentage of the
range of y values#'}

\item{dot_alpha}{opacity of the dots (0 = completely transparent,
1 = completely opaque). By default, \code{dot_alpha = 0.5}}

\item{dot_size}{size of the dots (default = 4)}

\item{legend_position}{position of the legend (default = "right").
If \code{legend_position = "none"}, the legend will be removed.}

\item{reg_line_types}{types of the regression lines for the two levels
of the independent variable.
By default, \code{reg_line_types = c("solid", "dashed")}}

\item{jn_line_types}{types of the lines for Johnson-Neyman points.
By default, \code{jn_line_types = c("solid", "solid")}}

\item{sig_region_color}{color of the significant region, i.e., range(s)
of the moderator variable for which simple effect of the independent
variable on the dependent variable is statistically significant.}

\item{sig_region_alpha}{opacity for \code{sig_region_color}.
(0 = completely transparent, 1 = completely opaque).
By default, \code{sig_region_alpha = 0.08}}

\item{nonsig_region_color}{color of the non-significant region,
i.e., range(s) of the moderator variable for which simple effect of
the independent variable on the dependent variable is not
statistically significant.}

\item{nonsig_region_alpha}{opacity for \code{nonsig_region_color}.
(0 = completely transparent, 1 = completely opaque).
By default, \code{nonsig_region_alpha = 0.08}}

\item{x_axis_title}{title of the x axis. By default, it will be set
as input for \code{mod_name}. If \code{x_axis_title = FALSE}, it will
be removed.}

\item{y_axis_title}{title of the y axis. By default, it will be set
as input for \code{dv_name}. If \code{y_axis_title = FALSE}, it will
be removed.}

\item{legend_title}{title of the legend. By default, it will be set
as input for \code{iv_name}. If \code{legend_title = FALSE}, it will
be removed.}
