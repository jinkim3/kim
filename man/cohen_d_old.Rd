\description{
Calculates Cohen's d and its confidence interval.
}
\details{
To construct confidence interval around Cohen's d with this function,
the following package(s) must be installed prior to running this function:
Package 'effsize' v0.8.1 (or possibly a higher version) by
Marco Torchiano (2020),
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=effsize}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
cohen_d_old(1:10, 3:12)
cohen_d_old(data = mtcars, iv_name = "vs", dv_name = "mpg", ci_range = 0.99)
}
}
