\title{Confidence Interval of the Mean of a Vector}
\usage{
ci_of_mean(x = NULL, confidence_level = 0.95, notify_na_count = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}

\item{confidence_level}{What is the desired confidence level
expressed as a decimal? (default = 0.95)}

\item{notify_na_count}{if \code{TRUE}, notify how many observations
were removed due to missing values. By default, NA count will be printed
only if there are any NA values.}
}
\value{
the output will be a named numeric vector with the
lower and upper limit of the confidence interval.
}
\description{
Returns the confidence interval of the mean of a numeric vector.
